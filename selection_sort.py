<Selection sort>

In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm.
It has an O(nÂ²) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists,
and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.

Worst-case complexity: n^2
Best complexity: n^2
Class: Sorting algorithm
